# TradingStrategyAI

## Project Overview

TradingStrategyAI is a machine learning-based project aimed at developing a trading strategy that can predict stock prices and identify profitable trading opportunities. The project leverages historical financial data and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can inform trading decisions.

### Objectives

1. Collect and preprocess historical financial data: Gather and clean historical stock prices and other relevant financial data.
2. Develop and train machine learning models: Train machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices and identify trends.
3. Implement and backtest trading strategies: Use the trained models to generate trading signals and evaluate their performance on historical data.
4. Optimize and refine the trading strategy: Continuously monitor and refine the trading strategy to improve its performance and adapt to changing market conditions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries.

### Required Libraries

* Pandas
